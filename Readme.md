Wizard is an AI-powered practice platform for JEE and NEET aspirants, built with a LeetCode-style interface. It offers subject-wise and topic-wise MCQ question banks, daily problems, streaks, levels, leaderboards, and shareable profiles to make exam prep engaging and competitive. The platform’s key differentiator is its AI-generated problems, which create fresh, adaptive, and cross-topic questions of varying difficulty, giving students an infinite problem set while helping them track progress, identify weak areas, and flaunt achievements just like coders do on LeetCode.
